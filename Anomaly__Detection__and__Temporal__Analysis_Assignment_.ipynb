        "     - The three common dimensionality reduction techniques are :     \n",
        "\n",
        "     - 1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a linear feature extraction technique that transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.\n",
        "     These components capture the maximum variance in the data.\n",
        "     PCA works by computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, projecting data onto directions that explain the most variability.\n",
        "     It is widely used for noise reduction, visualization, and speeding up machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - 2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique used mainly for classification problems.\n",
        "     Unlike PCA (which focuses on maximizing variance), LDA aims to maximize class separability by finding linear combinations of features that best distinguish between classes.\n",
        "     It computes projections based on the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance.\n",
        "     LDA is especially useful in face recognition, text classification, and pattern recognition tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - 3. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** : t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction method designed primarily for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.\n",
        "     It converts similarities between data points into probabilities and tries to preserve local structure (i.e., points that are close in high-dimensional space remain close in low-dimensional space).\n",
        "     t-SNE is highly effective for understanding clusters in complex datasets such as images, text embeddings, or gene expression data.\n",

        "   Similarity within a cluster is high (intra-cluster similarity).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Similarity between different clusters is low (inter-cluster dissimilarity).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Clustering helps in understanding the underlying structure of data, identifying meaningful subgroups, and simplifying complex datasets. It is widely used in various domains such as customer segmentation, market analysis, image grouping, document organization, biology, and anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Importance of Clustering**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Discovers hidden patterns and natural relationships in data.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    - Divisive (top-down): Start with one large cluster and split it recursively.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    - Anomaly detection (also called outlier detection) refers to the process of identifying data points, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the normal pattern or expected behavior in a dataset. These unusual instances may indicate important and often critical occurrences such as faults, frauds, intrusions, or system failures.\n",

        "  \n",
        "    - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the child or derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (called the parent or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "     It promotes code reusability, reduces duplication, and makes programs easier to maintain.\n",
        "     Using inheritance, new classes can extend or modify the functionality of existing classes without rewriting the original code.\n",

        "\n",
        "     - Time series anomaly detection involves identifying unusual, unexpected, or abnormal patterns in data collected over time. These anomalies may indicate faults, fraud, failures, or sudden changes in system behavior. Time series analysis provides statistical and machine-learning methods to detect such deviations from normal patterns.\n",

It is widely used in domains requiring early detection of faults, fraud, and unusual events."
